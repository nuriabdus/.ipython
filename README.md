I'm Nuriddin Abdussalaam — a data analyst in training with a Business Administration degree from William Peace University and 4+ years of technical experience at Corning. I'm currently completing a data science bootcamp with TripleTen, where I'm learning Python, SQL, Excel, and data visualization.

I’m passionate about uncovering insights from data, solving real-world problems, and creating clean, effective visuals that help people make better decisions.
